Powertrain Data Traceability and Performance Optimization via CANalyzer & CAPL:


In this project, I contributed to optimizing the vehicle powertrain system by developing diagnostic and validation scripts using CANalyzer and CAPL (Communication Access Programming Language). I streamlined the system requirement traceability using JAMA, enabling cross-domain integration between the powertrain and chassis subsystems. This approach resulted in a 25% reduction in validation time by automating CAN data monitoring, error detection, and performance logging. The solution significantly improved subsystem communication reliability and helped in root-cause diagnostics during system integration testing.
